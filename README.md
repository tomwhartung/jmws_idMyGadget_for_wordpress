# jmws_idMyGadget_for_wordpress

A version of idMyGadget tailored for use with the Wordpress CMS.

## Notes (while I'm thinking of them...)

JQuery Mobile in general, and the phone header/footer nav in particular, really look good only on phones.
Hence the name: *Phone* Header/Footer Nav.
I designed the options so that you can see them on tablets and desktops and judge for yourself.
Who am I to predict the use cases you will want to satisfy?

Yes you enable both header and footer phone navs at the same time.
If you only want one, say the header, simply do not assign a menu to the Phone Footer Nav theme position.
