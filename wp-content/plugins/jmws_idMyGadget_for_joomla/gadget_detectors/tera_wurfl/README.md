For information about this project, which does pretty much the same thing, but contains some joomla-specific modifications, see: https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla/blob/master/README.md .

I do not care to duplicate information about the main prject here, because it may change, and I might forget to update it, and confusion may ensue.
